==MushroomSpread==

MushroomSpread is a bukkit plugin. [bukkit.org]

Creates an overwhelming wave of Mushroom Island biome, eating all plants and most buildings in its path.

THIS WILL DESTROY YOUR CAREFULLY MADE MAP, UNLESS CONTROLLED THOROUGHLY! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

==Long version==

Mushroom Spread lets Mycelium spread 2-3 times faster, destroying grass and turning trees into giant mushrooms and most groundcover (flowers, fences, tallgrass, redstone, etc.) into small mushrooms.

It also changes the biome to MushroomIsland. Handy if you need rain in the desert... and don't mind losing your sand.

==Future hopes==

* Turn all mobs into Mooshrooms (or witches? Or iron golems? Or, maybe... IDK... Zombie pigmen, or something)
* Speed up mycelium spread using MC's built-in functions, or derivations thereof.
* Figure out a way of infecting water, somehow.
